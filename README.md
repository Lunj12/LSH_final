Object Detection and Retrieval by Linear Regression Classifier and Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)

This final project is focused on object detection and retrieval on MS-COCO dataset. A multi-category linear regression classifier and a nearest neighbor data structure based on locality-sensitive hashing were implemented for detection and retrieval, respectively. The results of object detection and retrieval, along with implementation details like hard negative mining and e2LSH were discussed.
